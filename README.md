## Deployment
Since you have already forgotten this like a hundred times...

*Dear Future Blake,*

* `source` is what it sounds like: source files. Do your work here.
* `middleman-deploy` provides a `deploy` task that does the dirty work. Use it like so:

        $ middleman build [--clean]
        $ middleman deploy [--build-before]

* Since the site is set up as a user page, it is deployed to `master`, not `gh-pages`.

*Go forth,*

*Past Blake*
